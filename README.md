### Welcome! 👋

I'm Jonathan and I'm not too sure what to put here, so I'm going to follow GitHub's lead. Protip: To get a profile like this, create a repo named the same thing as your username.

👨‍💻 My day job is working as a tech lead for [UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/).

🍺 I write a lot of code in my off hours too. My favorite kind of side project is one that can get to an MVP in a weekend, but that lends itself to endless iteration. I would love to collaborate on something small and useful. I most recently have been working on a Ruby clone of [Wordle](https://github.com/jonathanwthom/wordle).

💎 I write Ruby, JavaScript, and Go. I'm getting into Kubernetes.

🌎 You can visit my personal site at [jonathanthom.com](https://jonathanthom.com), but this page is probably a lot more interesting.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

🐶 The dog in my photo is Ernie. He has a "brother," Bert the cat 🐱.
